				<p>Interview process varies from company to company but here I attempt to explain how a typical process
				works. More details are provided for specific companies (
				<a href="info_google.html">Google</a>,
				<a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>,
				<a href="info_facebook.html">Facebook</a>,
				<a href="info_amazon.html">Amazon</a>,
				<a href="info_apple.html">Apple</a>,
				<a href="info_uber.html">Uber</a>).
				I break the process into multiple stages and go into each one of them in details:</p>

				</ul>

				<h3>Preparing to Apply:</h3>
				<p>The first step is to prepare a resume. Following are the tips for creating a great resume:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Resumes should be 1 to 2 pages long. For college candidates, 1 page should be sufficient
					and for experienced ones, 2 pages should be the max limit. Anything exceeding 2 pages is
					unlikely to be read.</li>
					<li>Keep the most interesting thing on top. A good idea would be to keep &#8531; or &#189;
					of the first page of resume as summary with all the achievements mentioned
					briefly. The rest of the resume can go into details. Generally, recruiters spend about 30
					seconds reading the first half of the resume. If they find it interesting, they will read
					more, otherwise it gets trashed. Keeping achievements on top maximizes the chance of them
					taking interest in your resume.</li>
					<li>Mention your accomplishments and not your job responsibilities.
					Use bullet points with each point written in 1 to 2 lines. Start with &#8220;What&#8221; you
					have accomplished and later &#8220;how&#8221; you did that. Try adding numbers where you can
					to show the impact.</li>
					<li>Provide links to your project, where you can. Also include links for your GitHub and
					LinkedIn profiles.</li>
					<li>Use a simple and easy to read format. The contents of the resume matters, not the
					formatting. Fancy formatting distracts the reader from the actual content.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Another good idea is to develop a personal website where you can upload your resume, professional
				interests, details of your projects, etc. The advantage of having a website is that it can easily
				be updated anytime as opposed to sending emails with attachments. Even free options like
				<a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> are good enough.</p>
				<p>Keep your LinkedIn profile up-to date (or create one if you don&#8217;t have it). In my opinion, 75%+
				hiring managers/recruiters would look you up in LinkedIn before starting any conversation with you.</p>

				<hr id="application" class="major"/>
				<h3>Application Process:</h3>
				<p>Many companies have college recruitment programs that they coordinate with the campus placement
				department for various colleges. So, if you are a student, the best option would be to talk to your
				campus placement department. Outside of that, feel free to directly apply to the companies you are
				interested in.</p>
				<p>You can apply to the career website of the companies directly though in my experience, it is very
				hard to get through. There are too many people who apply and generally the resume goes through
				automated filters that automatically screen out most of the resumes. While, I don&#8217;t want to discourage
				from applying on the career website, don&#8217;t expect much coming out of it.</p>
				<p>By far, the best way to get in is to have an employee referral. If you know someone, ask that person
				to forward your resume. Even if you don&#8217;t know the person very well, it still does not harm to ask.</p>
				<p>Another thing that I have noticed that works is to contact people on LinkedIn and asking for help.
				If you contact ten people, there is a decent chance that one of them would help you and that&#8217;s pretty
				much all you need. Even contacting recruiters on LinkedIn works and is definitely worth a try.</p>

				<hr id="initial" class="major"/>
				<h3>Initial Recruiter phone call:</h3>
				<p>Once the company decides to interview you, the recruiter from that company will contact you and set
				up an initial phone call. This is not so much of an interview as much as an information session. He/She
				will go on to explain the position, interview process and answer any questions you have. Recruiter should
				also provide you with some resources for preparation. Some basic HR type questions like Visa status,
				Willingness to relocate etc. are going to be asked.</p>
				<p>Key thing here is to listen and ask clarifying questions. Recruiters are generally there to help you
				so be nice to them. Ask for details on what interviewers would be looking for, tips &amp; tricks to perform
				well, and how best to prepare. While you are not being evaluated at this stage, be polite &amp; nice. If
				you come off as a jerk, it can be used against you. The golden rule is to treat every conversation as an
				interview and approach it with caution.</p>

				<hr id="manager" class="major"/>
				<h3>Hiring manager screening:</h3>
				<p>If you are applying for a specific position, there is a possibility that the hiring manager calls you
				first (e.g. <a href="info_apple.html">Apple</a>, <a href="info_uber.html">Uber</a>). This of course would
				not apply when you apply to a generic software engineer positions (e.g. <a href="info_google.html">Google</a>,
				<a href="info_facebook.html">Facebook</a>).</p>
				<p>Mostly, it is about understanding your experience and aspirations. Manager wants to ensure that you would
				be a good cultural fit and your future aspirations align well with the position/company. Additionally he/she
				wants to make sure you have all the skills necessary to succeed in the position, though he/she is unlikely
				to ask you deep technical questions (that will happen in later stages).</p>
				<p>Key to success at this stage is to understand the position, highlight the skills on your resume that are
				relevant to the position and in general show enthusiasm for the position/company. Another golden rule is
				to be brief. If a question requires a 2 mins answer then don&#8217;t give a 5 mins answer, stick to the point.
				Manager might be looking for red flags and if you talk more than required, you might accidentally say
				something that is a red flag (in fact, you should follow this rule throughout your professional career).</p>

				<hr id="auto" class="major"/>
				<h3>Automated Interview:</h3>
				<p>Some companies use automated platforms like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a> to do
				an initial technical screen. The questions usually would be some coding questions and additional multiple
				choice type questions. Such platforms are easy to use and have a sample problem that you can try to get
				familiarized with the system and it is often a good idea to do it especially if you are new to that
				platform.</p>
				<p>Key to success is to write good, clean code which is easy to read &amp; understand. See
				<a href="coding.html">this</a> section for more details on how to cracking the coding interview.</p>

				<hr id="phone" class="major"/>
				<h3>Phone Interview:</h3>
				<p>Phone interviews last for 45 mins to 60 mins and involve a Senior Software Engineer/Tech Lead who will
				ask technical questions from you. A typical interview would consist of 5 mins of intro, 5 mins at the end
				for Q&amp;A and rest of the interview for a coding question and sometimes depending on the position/company
				/seniority of the candidate, a system design or test question. Domain knowledge questions are
				generally not asked but there are exceptions to this rule (e.g. <a href="info_apple.html">Apple</a>).</p>
				<p>The meat of the interview is a coding problem which is covered in great details <a href="coding.html">here</a>.
				A shared doc or some online editor (<a href="https://www.coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a>,
				<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a>, etc.) will be used, where both parties can see
				what the other person is typing. Depending on the company, some require you to execute the code (e.g.
				<a href="info_uber.html">Uber</a>), Lyft) while others will simply look at your code and examine the
				logic (e.g. <a href="info_google.html">Google</a>, <a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>,
				<a href="info_facebook.html">Facebook</a>). Prepare some good questions for the Q&amp;A part (Don&#8217;t
				ask stupid questions like what is the vacation policy).</p>
				<p>Key to success involves listening to the problem, asking insightful questions, writing good clean
				code and showing enthusiasm for the position &amp; the company. While I don&#8217;t talk much about the cultural
				fit, it is as important as technical skills. The interviewer is trying to answer the question &#8220;Do I
				want to work with this guy?&#8221; and if you come off as a jerk, then the answer is &#8220;No&#8221;. As
				always, show enthusiasm for the company/position and keep your answers brief as mentioned at the end of
				<a href="#manager">this</a> section.</p>
				<p>An important thing to remember is to have a good internet connection during your interview. You are
				anyway at a disadvantageous position due to lack of face-to-face communication. Don&#8217;t make it worse due
				to bad technology.</p>

				<hr id="onsite" class="major"/>
				<h3>On-Site interview:</h3>
				<p>The one-site stage consists of 4 to 5 rounds of interview each lasting 45 mins to 60 mins. Most are
				1:1 but some do 2:1 (e.g. <a href="info_apple.html">Apple</a>). Sometimes, the interview is &#8220;
				shadowed&#8221; by another person who would sit quietly and watch (used for interview training).</p>
				<p>Most of the rounds would consist of standard coding questions but there could be behavioural interview
				and system design interview (Most for senior interview candidates) included also. Coding interviews are
				covered in greater details <a href="coding.html">here</a>. System design interviews check the ability of
				a candidate to design large-scale distributed systems. Behavioral job interviews focus on how you handled
				various work situations in the past. Your response will reveal your skills, abilities, and personality.
				They mostly involve giving you a situation (e.g. &#8220;Tell me a time when you have to deal with an impossible
				deadline, how did you deal with it&#8221;) and assessing your response.</p>
				<p>For on-site, usually they are done either on a whiteboard (<a href="info_google.html">Google</a> /
				<a href="info_facebook.html">Facebook</a> / <a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a> / <a href="info_amazon.html">
				Amazon</a>) or in front of the computer (Lyft/<a href="info_uber.html">Uber</a>), where you bring your own
				laptop and code. When you code on a laptop, you are expected to execute your code to make sure it works. For
				white board coding, the interviewer will examine the logic of your code. Minor syntax issues which are
				easily caught by the compiler are going to be ignored.</p>
				<p>Each interviewer generally probes a particular area. Most of the companies do a blind interviews where
				one interview does not talk to another one so they don&#8217;t get biased with each other. But some
				(e.g. <a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>) follow a process of continuous feedback where one interviewer
				will pass the feedback to the next interviewer. Also, in continuous feedback, Hiring manager or the decision
				maker would be the last person in the loop. If the first few interviews don&#8217;t go well, they can cut the process
				in the middle so you would not get to meet the hiring manager. If that happens, expect a negative answer.</p>
				<p>The interviewer is trying to answer the question &#8220;Do I want to work with this guy?&#8221;. So, make sure
				to be humble, polite, open to feedback and a good listener. Show enthusiasm towards the company &amp; the position
				and don&#8217;t make any controversial statements. The Interviewer wants you to do well and if they feel that you
				are off the track, they might give you hints to correct the course. If you prove yourself to be a rock star in the
				interview, they are very happy and it brightens up their day. Almost all interviewers will try to leave 5 minutes
				towards the end for additional questions so make sure to prepare some good questions.</p>
				<p>On a full day loop, there is a break for lunch where you and the one of the interviewers will have lunch together.
				Depending on the organization, Lunch interviewer will generally not submit feedback about you (There are exceptions
				like <a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>). It is your time to ask questions and know more about the company.
				However, you should treat every conversation as an interview. It is entirely possible to be rejected on a lunch
				interview if you say something nasty.</p>

				<hr id="offer" class="major"/>
				<h3>Post-Interview call:</h3>
				<p>The recruiter should follow-up with you regarding the outcome of the interview within 2 weeks of the on-site interview.
				If you get a positive answer, then you are all set (<a href="info_google.html">Google</a> is an exception where you move
				to the team selection stage). If you decide to accept the offer, then both parties agree on a start date. If you want
				to negotiate your salary, this is the time you do that. Hiring manager might call you to welcome you to his/her team and
				answer any questions you may have. You can choose to ask for some time to think and make a decision, in case you are
				expecting competing offers from other companies and want to wait for their outcome but don&#8217;t ask too much.
				Don&#8217;t try to be a jerk though because if you come across as one, your positive outcome can turn into negative
				outcome in no time.</p>
				<p>If the outcome is negative, then first of all thank the recruiter for his/her efforts. Always ask for feedback so
				you can improve next time (though some companies have a policy of not providing detailed feedback for legal reasons).
				Ask the recruiter when you can reapply again. Typically, companies have some period before you can reapply (e.g.
				<a href="info_google.html">Google&#8217;s</a> waiting period is 12 months). The period varies from company to company
				so always best to ask your recruiter this question. Bear in mind that many engineers (even at places like
				<a href="info_google.html">Google</a>) fail at their first attempt so it is not the end of the road. Build a good
				relationship with the recruiter as they change companies often so the same person can be of resource to you in a
				different organization. Regardless of the outcome of the interview, Always be humble and polite.</p>
