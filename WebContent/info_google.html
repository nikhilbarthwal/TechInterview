				<p>In Google, the hiring managers do not have power to hire people directly in their teams. All candidates
				need to be approved by the hiring committee (A Google wide organization) and only then hiring managers can
				hire them into their team. This ensures that everyone who gets hired is above a certain bar.</p>
				<p>Initial part of the process is pretty much like any other company. Recruiter will call you and help you
				prepare for the interview. You would then have a phone interview. If you are a border-line case, they
				sometimes do a second phone interview. They use Google docs and then the interviewer will send you a link
				to a shared doc. You would type code into the docs and the interviewer can see it real-time. Questions will
				cover the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms). The interviewer will judge
				you on the logic of the code and typically will not execute your code. Hence minor syntax issues are going
				to be ignored. Sometimes the interviewer might ask you some basic knowledge related questions (e.g. Explain
				Hashmaps).</p>
				<p>Assuming you clear the phone interview, you are invited on-site to meet 4 to 5 engineers. There will also
				be a lunch interview, who will not submit any feedback (but always treat every conversation as an interview)
				and is there to answer your questions about the company. All coding questions will be done on a white board
				and the interviewer will take a photograph of the whiteboard at the end for his record. All interviews are
				supposed to be blind i.e. interviewers will not share their feedback with each other. Questions will be
				similar to the phone interview and will cover the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp;
				Algorithms). For senior engineers, one of the interviews will be a System design interview. For test
				engineering positions, there will be an interview to test your testing skills. Google tends not to ask any
				brainteasers and there is no behavior interview either.</p>
				<p>All information including Interviewer's feedback, your resume etc. will go to the hiring committee (HC).
				The hiring committee then makes a decision on your case. This is the stage where most of the candidates fail.
				If they reject you, that would be the end of the process. Make sure to thank the recruiter and remember you
				can still re-apply after 12 months. If they approve you, you move to the next stage of the process, which is
				team matching.</p>
				<p>Until this point, you didn't have to make any decision on teams or location but now the recruiter will ask
				you about your preferences for teams/product area/location and based on your criteria, your feedback will be
				circulated among the hiring managers who have openings in their team. One thing to be noted is that once
				you are approved by HC, you can pick any location or product area. So, you can be interviewed in California
				and pick Tokyo or London as your choice of location. Another thing, the interviews are generic so even if you are
				interested in Android development, you will still be mostly assessed on the fundamentals of computer science.</p>
				<p>The recruiter will get back to you with the teams that are interested in your profile and will arrange phone
				calls with the hiring manager for each team (you can even request to meet in person, if you happen to be in the
				same city). Each manager will pitch his/her team to you and might ask you questions about your career goals &amp;
				interests. Based on this conversation, you and the manager will make a decision on whether this would be a good fit
				or not. You can have follow-up conversations or emails, if you have more questions. In practice, most the hiring
				managers have already made up their mind to take you if they are reaching out to you and mostly you are selecting
				them as opposed to them selecting you.</p>
				<p>Salary is decided by a separate committee called the compensation committee, which is different from the hiring
				committee or hiring manager. Salary is NOT to be discussed with hiring managers.</p>
				<p>After a couple of days, you are expected to get back to the recruiter with your list of preferences. Your recruiter
				will check with the managers of each team in serial order and the first manager in your preference list who accepts
				you will be the team that is assigned to you. Once the team is decided, the last step is the executive approval.
				Google will do a background check also at this stage by identifying people who worked in the same company as you
				during the same time (as indicated in your resume). They will send these people notifications about you and if they
				know you, they will be asked to write feedback about you.</p>
				<p>All your details including notes from HC and background check reports will be sent to a Google executive (usually
				a VP) who has to sign-off. It is rare for an executive to reject you unless there is something negative in your
				background check. Once the executive approval is done, Google will make you an offer.</p>
