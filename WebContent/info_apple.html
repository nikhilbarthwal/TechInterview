				<p>Apple follows a team specific interview, where each team acts as a start-up and manages its own recruitment.
				In fact, you can be interviewed by multiple teams simultaneously and get multiple offers also in which case you
				choose the team you want to work with. Typical Apple process consists of recruiter pre-screen, phone call from
				the hiring manager/tech lead of the team to determine cultural fit followed by 1 to 2 technical phone screens.
				Please bear in mind that the process varies from team to team and the questions will also depend on the
				team/hiring manager.</p>
				<p>The phone screen will consist of a mix of resume Q &amp; A, coding questions centered around data structures
				&amp; algorithms, and domain knowledge of the area the team works in. Each interview can last between 45 mins
				to 60 mins and the coding question uses a shared editor like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>.
				The questions tend to be very specific to the team as Apple tries to look for an exact fit. If you clear the
				phone screen, you will move to the on-site which consists of 5 to 7 interviews. Each interview will either be
				a 1:1 or 2:1 and will be about 45 min to 1 hour. Two interviewers simultaneously may seem overwhelming as they
				may pose questions one after another giving you little time to answer. In any case, make sure you take one
				question at a time and stay focused.</p>
				<p>Much like phone interviews, on-site interviews will also be a mix of resume Q &amp; A, behavioral questions,
				coding and domain knowledge. Apple interviews for specific teams so they expect you to know the product or
				service you are interviewing for, ideas about how it works and knowledge of the subject area in general. So,
				if you are interviewing for the iOS team, expect a lot of questions on Operating Systems. As mentioned before,
				Apple tries to look for an exact fit so there will be questions based around problems the team is looking to
				solve and technical questions related to the job.</p>
				<p>Apple is big in behavioral questions and would dive into your enthusiasm for Apple, how you work in teams,
				how you work under pressure, and times you have displayed leadership, etc. Apple employees tend to love Apple
				products and Apple would expect the same enthusiasm from you. <a href="coding.html">Coding</a> questions will
				cover the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) and you can pick any language.
				Lunch interview is also an interview and be prepared to talk about your domain expertise and how you can
				contribute to the problems they are solving. It often happens with the hiring manager.</p>
				<p>Apple has two tracks for software engineering positions. The regular software engineer and Site Reliability
				Engineers (SRE). SRE&#8217;s positions exist in the Apple Cloud Infrastructure (ACI) team and their day to day jobs
				involve a lot of fire-fighting to ensure that Apple services run reliably. Hence for SRE positions, expect a
				lot of debugging questions where the interview(s) will give you a situation where something is not working and
				will ask you for steps that you would take to fix the problem.</p>
				<p>At the end of the interview, the interviewers will sit together and share their notes and arrive at a decision.
				If your interviews went well, your recruiter will reach out to you and make you an offer. In the event you do
				not receive an offer, you will most likely have to wait 3-6 months before reapplying for the same position. But
				Apple will consider you for other positions and you can get another round of interviews if they find a fit for
				you on another team. You do not necessarily have to wait to re-apply to another position at the company.</p>
