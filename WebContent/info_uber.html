				<p>Uber also interviews candidates for specific teams and uses the industry standard format of interview
				by asking questions that cover the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms).
				However, Uber requires you to produce a working code, so you are supposed to compile &amp; execute the
				code to make sure it works correctly. For their phone interview, they will use a platform like
				<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> and for on-site stage, you are expected to bring your
				own laptop with the coding environment setup. You are free to choose the programming language of your
				choice though.</p>
				<p>Initially the recruiter will give you information on team/position, explain the process and help you
				prepare for the interview. This might be followed by a call from the hiring manager who will tell you more
				about the team. Next stage will be the phone interview with a coding question(s). If you clear that, you
				move to the on-site stage.</p>
				<p>The on-site stage will consist of 4 to 5 interviews. Generally, there will be no separate lunch
				interview and one of the interviewers will take you out for lunch. Hiring manager will be on the
				panel and will mostly ask behavioral questions and assess cultural fit. For junior candidates, Uber tends
				to ask API design questions and for senior candidates, there will be a system design question. The rest of
				the interviews will be coding/problem solving.</p>
				<p>Uber also uses the concept of a &#8220;bar raiser&#8221;, who has veto power over the outcome of your
				interview. So, the interview panel consists of members of the team you are being considered for and the
				bar raiser, who is from another team. It is easy to identify the bar raiser, even though the candidate is not
				officially told who he/she is. Ask everyone which team they belong to &amp; what they do and you will notice
				that one person will have a different answer from the rest. Uber does blind interviews, so interviewers will
				not share feedback with each other until they debrief.</p>
				<p>Recruiter will follow-up with you after a few days with a decision. If they reject you, there is a waiting
				period before you can be re-interviewed. If it is positive, Uber will make an offer to you.</p>
