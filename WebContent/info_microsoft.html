				<p>Microsoft has two different processes for recruitment, one for college students and the other for experienced
				folks. For college recruitment, they work with the campus placement team at various universities. The recruiter
				will come to the campus and shortlist candidates based on their resume. The shortlisted candidates would go for a
				screening round, which is taken by a Microsoft manager/engineer who would also come to the campus (equivalent to a
				phone interview but done in person). Questions will cover the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp;
				Algorithms). Microsoft will &#8220;fly back&#8221; the selected candidates. The college candidates are interviewed for
				specific team(s) which are picked by the recruiter based on open headcounts. They are interviewed for 1 to 2 teams but
				they are often not told which team(s) they are. For this reason, there are no team specific questions that are asked.
				It can happen that when you join, you join a completely different team than what you were interviewed with. If you have
				graduated from college less than 12 months ago and apply from outside, you will still follow the college recruiting
				process, though they may do a phone interview if they are not coming to a place near you.</p>
				<p>The experienced candidates will start with a phone interview and if they clear it, they move to the on-site stage.
				In Microsoft, you are interviewed for a specific position in a team (unlike <a href="info_google.html">Google</a>,
				where interviews are across all teams) and candidates would know in advance which team they are interviewing with
				(which is different from college recruitment).</p>
				<p>Questions will cover the fundamentals of computer science (same as phone interview/screening). For experienced candidates,
				there can be knowledge specific/team specific questions that can be asked. They judge you on the logic of the code and all
				coding is done on whiteboard. Interviewers will not execute your code and hence syntax issues are going to be ignored.
				Microsoft follows a process of continuous feedback where one interviewer will pass the feedback to the next interviewer.
				Hiring manager or the decision maker would be the last person in the loop. If the first few interviews don't go well, they
				can cut the process in the middle so you would not be meeting the hiring manager. If that happens to you, it means you failed
				the interview.</p>
				<p>Recruiter will follow-up with you after a few days with a decision. If they reject you, there is a waiting period of about
				12 months before you can be re-interviewed for college candidates. For experienced candidates, they can be interviewed by a
				different team though they will still have some waiting period. If the outcome is positive, Microsoft will make an offer.
				Microsoft will not generally negotiate salaries for college candidates but there is some room to negotiate for experienced
				candidates.</p>
