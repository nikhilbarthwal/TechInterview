				<ul>
					<li id="i_am_old_can_i_apply"><b>I am 40+, Can I apply?</b><br/><br/>
					<p>Certainly, I know several people who applied and were hired late into their career. So, age by itself does
					not bar you from being considered (In fact, it would be illegal to do so). That being said, for most tech
					companies, their interview process involves testing the fundamentals of computer science (Data structures
					&amp; Algorithms).</p>
					<p>Most working professionals would have studied these topics a long time ago in college and they would have
					likely forgotten them by now. This favors recent graduates whose memory is still fresh.
					The advice I have here is to brush up fundamentals concepts (See <a href="material.html">Study Material</a>
					and <a href="coding.html">How</a> to answer coding questions). A common mistake I have seen with experienced
					professionals is to rely on their practical skills &amp; knowledge gained by years of work experience and not
					studying the basics enough. Practical knowledge would help you once you get in, but does not help you much in
					the interview itself.</p><br/></li>
					<li id="i_am_experianced_can_i_apply_for_new_grad"><b>I have several years of experience, Can I apply for a
					new grad position?</b><br/><br/>
					<p>If a position is listed as new grad position, most likely No. Some companies would consider recent graduates
					(graduated within the last 12 months) also but if you have exceed the limit then they won&#8217;t consider.
					However it is possible to request the recruiter to be considered for a junior position.</p>
					<p>For example, <a href="info_google.html">Google&#8217;s</a>, L3 is a wide band and that includes both new grads
					and industry experianced professionals can be hired at this level. <a href="info_microsoft.html">Microsoft</a> is
					relatively strict and would not consider experianced candidates for SDE1 (Their new grad positions). However, you
					can make a request to be considered for SDE2 positions (Level:61) which is the next higher position.</p><br/></li>
					<li><b>I am not from a top college, Do I have a chance?</b><br/><br/>
					<p id="i_am_not_from_top_college_can_i_apply">Of course! This is a total myth that you need a Stanford/MIT/Harvard
					degree to get into Google, Microsoft, etc. Tons of my colleagues, including some of the best I have met,
					graduated from colleges that I had never even heard the name.</p>
					<p>Also note that for colleges, big tech companies hire candidates in big numbers. For college candidates, it is not
					possible to hire exclusively from top tier colleges, simply because the demand would exceed the supply. And for
					experienced candidates, the work experience would matter more than college degrees anyway, so a solid work experience
					can compensate for any degree (or having no degree also in some cases).</p><br/></li>
					<li><b id="do_i_need_cse_degree">Do I need a Computer Science/Engineering degree?</b><br/><br/>
					<p>For experienced candidates, it will not matter as long as your employment history is relevant to the position.
					For a college degree, the recruiters would target the computer engineering candidates but if you show enough
					enthusiasm, then they will consider you. Bear in mind though that you will still have to clear
					the interview and the bar is the same for everyone, regardless of your major.</p><br/></li>
					<li id="would_contributing_to_oss_help"><b>Would contributing to open source projects increase my chance of getting
					in?</b><br/><br/>
					<p>Not as much as you would think (Unless you are very famous in the community).
					For college candidates, it would look good on your resume and certainly help in getting shortlisted for an interview.
					For experienced candidates, usually employment history will have more weight than open source contributions (again,
					exceptions apply). However, they will have very little impact on the interview, which is the deciding factor in getting
					an offer.</p>
					<p>My advice here is that you want to contribute to open source projects, you should surely do it. However don't do it
					just to get a job as it is not worth the effort. Brushing up fundamentals and practicing problems on a whiteboard are a
					better investment of time, if your only aim is to get a job.</p><br/></li>
					<li id="can_i_apply_overseas"><b>For generalist positions in Google or Facebook, Can I apply to positions
					overseas?</b><br/><br/>
					<p>Yes, absolutely. The nature of the process is that once you are approved by the hiring
					committee, you can be considered for any position throughout the world (See <a href="info_google.html">Google</a>
					&amp; <a href="info_facebook.html">Facebook</a> for more details). For example, if you are US based, you can get
					interviewed in California and but placed in London or Tokyo. In fact, they offer you great internal mobility so you can
					even start working in the US and shift overseas later on. Depending on the company, they usually would want you to
					stay in one position for a year and then allow you to move anywhere you want.</p><br/></li>
