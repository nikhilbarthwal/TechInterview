				<p>Facebook's process is pretty much the same as <a href="info_google.html">Google&#8217;s</a>
				until the team selection stage for generic positions. Hiring managers can&#8217;t hire people
				directly but have to go through the pool of candidates approved by the hiring committee. Facebook
				does have specialist positions which don&#8217;t follow this model and teams recruit you directly.</p>
				<p>Recruiter will call you and help you prepare for the interview. You would then have one or two
				phone interviews. Facebook gives you the option to come to the office and give your &#8220;phone
				interview&#8221; in person if you are a local candidate. They would use
				<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> as the platform and the questions would cover
				fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms). They judge you on the logic of
				the code. Code will not be executed and hence minor syntax issues are going to be ignored.</p>
				<p>Assuming you clear the phone interview, you are invited on-site to meet 4 to 5 engineers. The lunch
				interviewer will not submit his feedback (but treat it as an interview anyway). All coding questions
				will happen on the white board and all interviews are supposed to be blind (Interviewers will not share
				their feedback with each other). For senior engineers, there will be a system design interview and
				also a behavioral interview. In a behavioral interview, the interviewer will ask questions about
				your certain situation that you faced in the past and focus on how you handled that situation. Expect no
				brainteasers or puzzles.</p>
				<p>All information including feedback from all interviewers will go to the hiring committee and
				the hiring committee will then make a decision on your case. If they reject you, thank the recruiter
				and remember you can still re-apply after 12 months.</p>
				<p>If they select you, the recruiter will roll out an offer to you. What is unique about Facebook is
				&#8220;Bootcamp&#8221;. While in Google, you select the team before you join the company, at Facebook
				you select the team after you join the company. All new engineers go through an immersion program called
				Bootcamp where you work for multiple teams across the company for a couple of days and decide which team
				you want to join. Bootcamp typically lasts for 5 to 8 weeks. An old reference to Bootcamp is available
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-engineering-bootcamp/177577963919/">
				here</a>.</p>
