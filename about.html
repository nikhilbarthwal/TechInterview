				<h3>About me:</h3>
				<p>I currently work at Google and in the past, I have worked for Microsoft and other companies. Over the last
				decade or so, I have been interviewed by many companies. Therefore, I have considerable experience in how tech
				companies evaluate interview candidates. I have also been involved in recruitment for the organization I
				worked for, as a result I have gained experience on both sides of the table.</p>

				<p>I get a lot of questions from other people about how to get a job in top-tier tech companies in
				general: What is the best way to apply, what kind of questions are asked, how to ace the interview etc.
				So I have created this website in an attempt to answer all these questions for everyone.</p>

				<hr class="major"/>
				<h3>The story of this site:</h3>
				<p>Back when I was doing my PhD, Microsoft came to university for recruitment. I applied
				for a job as Software Developer and was shortlisted for an interview. To prepare for the interview, I read
				several books, practiced coding questions on paper and took lot of notes. I aced the interview and started
				working for Microsoft.</p>

				<p>In the next decade or so, I switched a couple of jobs and was interviewed by several companies. I reused
				the notes I had prepared initially and kept on updating them with more content.  At one point of time, I
				realized that these could be of use to others as well, so I am now making all the information I have public.</p>

				<p>I hope that the material provided here would help you ace your tech interview. If you have any comments
				or suggestions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@tech-interviews.io">contact</a> me.</p>

				<p>I have attempted to provide you with the best possible advice I have and I strive to keep the material up-to
				date. Feedback is always welcome!</p>
