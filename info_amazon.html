				<p>In Amazon, candidates are interviewed for specific teams. Amazon interviews use the industry standard
				format that covers the fundamentals of computer science (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms).</p>
				<p>Initially the recruiter will give you information on the team/position, explain the process and help
				you prepare for the interview. This might (sometimes) be followed by a call from the hiring manager who
				will tell about the team and specific role he/she is looking to fill. Following that, there will be a
				phone interview which will have a coding question and sometimes a system design question also for senior
				candidates. If you clear that, you move to the
				<a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview">on-site stage</a>. The on-site
				stage will consist of 4 to 5 interviews and a separate lunch interview.</p>
				<p>One thing particular about Amazon interviews is the concept of &#8220;Bar raiser&#8221;. The interview
				panel will have one person called the bar raiser who comes from another team. This person has veto power
				over the outcome of your interview and exists to make sure every team hires candidates of equal
				caliber. While the candidate is not told who the bar raiser is, it is easy to spot him/her. Just ask
				everyone which team they belong to and what they do and you will notice that one person will have a
				different answer from the rest. The hiring manager and the bar raiser are the two most important people
				in panel though others are important too. Amazon does blind interviews, so interviewers will not share
				feedback with each other until they enter it into their system.</p>
				<p>Interviews are a mix of coding, behavior and system design. Coding interviews are done on white board
				where the candidate will write code. The interviewer will examine the logic of the code and ignore minor
				syntax issues. For system design, the candidate will come up with a design on a whiteboard.  For Amazon (
				specially <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/AWS">AWS</a>), pay special attention to scalability in your
				system design.</p>
				<p>In a behavioral interview, the interviewer will ask questions about certain  situations that you faced in
				the past and focus on how you handled that situation. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles">
				14 Leadership principles</a> that they want you to know and the interview will be looking for examples of how
				you apply them in practice. They prefer that you answer in
				<a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/star-interview-format">STAR</a> format.</p>
				<p>Recruiter will follow-up with you after a few days with a decision. If they reject you, there is a waiting
				period before you can be interviewed again. If the outcome is positive, Amazon will make you an offer</p>
